# eye-disease-classification
This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of classifying eye diseases into four distinct categories: normal, cataract, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma. Utilizing a dataset of over 4,000 images, the model was trained to recognize and differentiate between these conditions with high accuracy. The project employed techniques such as data augmentation to enhance the dataset and fine-tuning to optimize model performance.


Dataset
The dataset consists of Normal, Diabetic Retinopathy, Cataract, and Glaucoma retinal images, where each class has approximately 1000 images. These images are collected from various sources like IDRiD, Oculur recognition, HRF, etc. The dataset can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gunavenkatdoddi/eye-diseases-classification
